# nolocker

A decentralized auto insurance service, with open investments.

## Overview

nolocker is a path to secure your vehicle much more conveniently than the usual way. Clients can rest assure of the safety of their car, while investors can insert money in a liquidity pool, sharing the overall profit. In this initial phase, the moment the client asks for an one-year insurance in our platform, a NFT is minted to our wallet. Then, we achieve the responsability of that vehicle, and make that NFT available to possible investors in our marketplace. If an investor decides to buy that NFT, he becomes the owner and shall receive his participation of the profits after the period of one year.

In the unfortunate case of an accident or theft, we would cover the losses just like a normal insurance would. 
Our system uses market-proven mathematical equations to determine how much the insurance will cost and how much investors will receive, making our only difference the ecosystem we use: more transparent and easier.
